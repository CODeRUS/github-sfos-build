### Useful cases

Three useful cases are listed here here below:

* [build on demand](examples/build-on-demand.yml)
* [build on pull](examples/build-on-pull.yml)
* [build on tags](examples/build-on-tags.yml)

Also build on tags can be run on-demand by user for test purposes but it also run when triggered by a tag set on the HEAD of the default branch. Therefore the last example includes and extend the functionality of the first one. About the *build on pull*, same story but triggered by a pull instead.
