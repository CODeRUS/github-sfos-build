## GitHub-action for building Sailfish OS apps

For the available SailFish OS build target releases:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/coderus/sailfishos-platform-sdk/tags

or use `latest` to be always on the edge of the container updates.

### Usage

```
uses: coderus/github-sfos-build@master
with:
  release: <release>
  arch: <arch>
```

```

### Useful cases

Three useful cases are listed here here below:

* [build on demand](examples/build-on-demand.yml)
* [build on pull](examples/build-on-pull.yml)
* [build on tags](examples/build-on-tags.yml)

Also build on tags can be run on-demand by user for test pourposes but it also run when triggered by a tag set on the HEAD of the default branch. Therefore the last example includes and extend the functionality of the first one. About the *build on pull*, same story but triggered by a pull instead.
